-> In short, Lido stakes the ETH on the beacon chain using keys from trusted operators, but the ETH stays within Lido’s control, not in the operators’ hands
-> The withdrawal credentials in the deposit transaction point to Lido’s smart contract, not the node operator’s address
-> validators keys sharing mechanism -(https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_036e057e-0c0b-422c-af88-608a61f67774)
-> when we stake eth under validator , these staked ether linked to the withdrawl address and only they can able to withdraw the staked ether and rewards
