-> liquid staking builds upon existing staking systems by unlocking liquidity for staked tokens ( like getting stETH for ETH for staking )
-> Liquid staking provides all of the benefits of traditional staking services while unlocking the value of staked assets for use as collateral across the DeFi ecosystem
-> validators in liquid staking - (https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_8052d314-ca39-419f-9579-9ff3537f964b)
-> In short, Lido stakes the ETH on the beacon chain using keys from trusted operators, but the ETH stays within Lido's control, not in the operators' hands
-> The withdrawal credentials in the deposit transaction point to Lido's smart contract, not the node operator's address
-> validators keys sharing mechanism -(https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_036e057e-0c0b-422c-af88-608a61f67774)
-> when we stake eth under validator , these staked ether linked to the withdrawl address and only they can able to withdraw the staked ether and rewards
-> oracles in lido - https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_03b8d0a8-09a5-4d78-aa9f-e350bc1eee6f
-> Lido use DVT ( Distributed validator technology )

-> validator metrics - (https://explorer.rated.network/o/0x798cf8fc6f212da30b10cac6e05b4bf275c34bff?network=mainnet&timeWindow=1d&idType=depositAddress)
-> strategy refers to in DEFI ( we will be putting some collateral and in return with the help of the strategy we will the protocol will give us the rewards)
-> Type of liquidity tokens
   - rebasing tokens ( exchange rate will aways be 1:1 , quantity increases )
   - non rebasing token ( exchange rate will icrease over time , quantity is constant )
-> Rewards for an validator 
   - consensus layer ( Newly Minted ETH ) - we cant able to withdraw immediately
   - executin layer ( Priority fees and MEV fees) - immediate withdrawal
