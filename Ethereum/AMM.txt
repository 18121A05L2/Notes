-> AMM - x * y = k ( x = Asset A , y = Asset B , k = Constant value ) 
-> price of Asset x = x / y
-> price of Asset y = y / x
From the above equations we can get the below two equations
-> reserve of x**2 = K / price of x
-> reserve of y**2 = K * price of y
-> At a price of 4000 USDT/ETH: ( invested 1 eth at 2000 price )
Pool Reserves: Approximately 0.7071 ETH and 2828.43 USDT.
Total Value upon Removal: ~5656.86 USDT.
Impermanent Loss: ~343.14 USDT compared to simply holding.

At a price of 5000 USDT/ETH:
Pool Reserves: Approximately 0.6325 ETH and 3162.28 USDT.
Total Value upon Removal: ~6324.78 USDT.
Impermanent Loss: ~675.22 USDT compared to holding.

At 1000 USDT/ETH:
Pool Reserves: ≈ 1.4142 ETH and ≈ 1414.21 USDT
Total Value: ≈ 2828.42 USDT
If Held: 3000 USDT
Impermanent Loss: ≈ 171.58 USDT

At 500 USDT/ETH:
Pool Reserves: 2 ETH and 1000 USDT
Total Value: 2000 USDT
If Held: 2500 USDT
Impermanent Loss: 500 USDT

For a Price Drop to 0.1 USDT/ETH: ( TODO: this is red flag for liquidity providers )
The pool rebalances to roughly 141.42 ETH and 14.14 USDT. The total value becomes a meager 28.28 USDT. 
In contrast, holding your original tokens would be worth about 2000.1 USDT. This demonstrates an extreme 
impermanent loss where the vast majority of value is lost.
