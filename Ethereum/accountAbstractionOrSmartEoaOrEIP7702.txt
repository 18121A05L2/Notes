------------------------------------- EIP-4337 - ACCOUNT ABSTRACTION -----------------------------------------

-> use cases - dead man swith - we can add something like if after 50 years transfer this owernship to the new 
    owner ( family) . this can be transferred after one year of account inactive
-> pay gas with any ERC20 token
-> wihtrawing tokens from tornado cash with a new account we can pay gas with the withdrawng token , instead of 
    sending token to the new account for gas
-> Multiple transactions at a time
-> delayed operations
-> Every single account on zksync is a smart contract account which follows DefaultAccount.sol era-contract
-> UserOperations -> altmem pool -> bundlers -> handleOps( Entrypoint.sol) -> ValidateUserOp (AA.sol)
-> smart contract wallets 
    - can be programmed ,which can have code which is not possible in EOA
    - can initiate a transaction just like EOA
    - does not need funds in this like an EOA ( paymasters will pay gas fees for you )
    - can able to sign transactions in batches




--------------------------------------- EIP-7702 - smart EOAs -------------------------------------------------
-> When a transaction is sent to the EOA, the logic at the designated smart contract is executed, while preserving the EOA as the msg.sender
-> When the transaction executes, msg.sender is still the EOA's address, and tx.origin is also the EOA's address
-> EOA will be the proxy and Delegation contract will be the logic contract

--------------------------------------- NATIVE ACCOUNT ABSTRACTION ---------------------------------------------

-> each operation will be sub divided into individual frame for faster execution
-> Each block builder can run independently on the same state and the overall block execution will be done once 
    all individaul transactions are completed to check any transactions are invalid 
-> we need to send Transaction type as 113 for account abstraction in Zksync
-> just like the Entrypoint contract in Ethereum , we have bootloader system contract in ZKsync for native AA
