-> Event logs in solidity are stored as - topics[0] will be the selector and topics[1] will be the index params if we have
-> Stateless (Fuzz) Fuzz Testing : Where the state of the previous run is discarded for every new run.
-> Stateful (Invarient) Fuzz Testing : Where the final state of the previous run is the starting state of the next run
-> In an individaul test follow these steps -> Arrange , Act and Assert
-> (Stateless) Fuzz test - random data for a single function
-> (Stateful) Invarient tests - Random data and random function calls to many functions ( function name should be invariant_* )
-> Linearization of inheritance graph impossiblesolidity -- Solidity expects the list to be from most base-like to most derived
