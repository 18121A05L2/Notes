-> System contracts - Difference between Zksync and Ethereum Mainnet 
-> system contract call - SystemContractsCaller.systemCallWithPropagatedRevert
-> foundryup-zksync
-> forge build --zksync
-> Contracts with a large number of instructions will not compile on ZKsync due to the 65535 addressable space limitation imposed by zksolc
-> The zksolc compiler enforces a limit on the number of instructions a contract can have, capped at 2^16 instructions. If a contract exceeds this limit, the compilation will fail.
-> Sequencer responsibilities
     - Accept user transactions. 
     - Order and execute transactions. 
     - Batch transactions for submission to Ethereum L1.
     - Provide fast but non-final confirmations.
