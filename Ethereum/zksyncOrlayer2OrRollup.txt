-> System contracts - Difference between Zksync and Ethereum Mainnet 
   - System contracts are a specialized set of contracts in virtual machines (VM) that enhance the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by supporting opcodes not available by default
   - https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-protocol/contracts/system-contracts
-> system contract call - SystemContractsCaller.systemCallWithPropagatedRevert
-> foundryup-zksync
-> forge build --zksync
-> Contracts with a large number of instructions will not compile on ZKsync due to the 65535 addressable space limitation imposed by zksolc
-> The zksolc compiler enforces a limit on the number of instructions a contract can have, capped at 2^16 instructions. If a contract 
     exceeds this limit, the compilation will fail.
-> Sequencer responsibilities
     - Accept user transactions. 
     - Reads user transactions from an L2 mempool
     - Order and execute transactions. 
     - Batch transactions for submission to Ethereum L1.
     - Provide fast but non-final confirmations.
-> zero knowledge proofs - the ability to prove honest computation without revealing the inputs 
-> circum and snarkjs - DSL for zksnarks
-> when we have 4 inputs in a merkle tree - Proof 1 = Hash 2 , Proof 2 = Hash 3-4 ( These are the proofs that we are going to provide 
     for the first input as an aarray of proofs)

-> Leaf Node to Verify: L0
   Merkle Proof: The following sibling hashes are required to reconstruct the path to the root:
   L1
   H8 (sibling of H7)
   H4 (sibling of H3)
   H2 (sibling of H1)
-> zkSync uses two nonces: a deployment nonce (for create calls) and a transaction nonce (for replay protection). This affects contract 
     address calculation, so tweak your Foundry scripts accordingly
