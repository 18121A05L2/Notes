-> React is a library for building user interfaces , it was not a framework
-> Hooks - state , context , Ref , effect and performance 
-> npx - npm package runner
    - Does not install globally: npx downloads and runs the latest version of create-react-app temporarily.
-> Peer dependencies need to be specified in the libraries ( like whoever are publishing packages to npm )
-> useCallback hook memoizes the function itself, not its return value. useMemo caches the functions return value so that the function need not execute again
-> useCallback is used to cache a function to avoid re-creating it on every re-render
-> componentDidMount
    Hook: useEffect(() => { ... }, []) — Runs after the first render.

    componentDidUpdate
    Hook: useEffect(() => { ... }, [deps]) — Runs when dependencies change.

    componentWillUnmount
    Hook: useEffect(() => { return () => {...} }, []) — Cleanup before component unmounts.

-> Portals - Render children into a DOM node outside the parent hierarchy (e.g., for modals).
    - Event bubbling in portal works just like the normal child components in the parent hierarchy.
-> Streaming allows you to break down the page's HTML into smaller chunks and progressively send those chunks from the server to the client.
-> Context API - we will provide the state and dispatch when wrapping contextProvider and use those using useContext
-> useCallback - if we have a function in a component and it will create each time when a component is rendered , with this it wont recreate until unless dependencies of it are changed
-> useRef -  To persist a mutable value across renders without triggering re-renders , for mutable persistent values that don’t cause re-renders
-> Rendering - The commit phase is usually fast but the render phase can be slow.
    - same value after rerenders , react will render one more time for that component and bails out from any subsequest renders
    - In React, the rendering process is divided into two main phases: the “render phase” and the “commit phase
    - React looks for any useEffect hooks declared in the component in the commit phase and executes their effect functions
    - (non primitive data types) same array and object references does not queue up for re-renders
    # - (if parent re-renders) the child components would went through the render phase but not commit phase
-> Parent and child and parent and children props ( <><Child/></>) , differs in rendering 
    - in first case child renders whenever the parent renders but not in the second case
    - if parent for both these renders , then at that time these two will render
-> React.memo comes with an extra cost
-> Noraml Script - Html parsing (and if it encounter any script tag) + fetch the script tag resources + execute the script tag js and then continue HTML parsing
-> Async Script - Html parsing (and if it encounter any script tag) + execute the script tag js and then continue HTML parsing
                             + fetch the script tag resources in parallel
-> defer script - HTML parsing                              After HTML parsing is done + execute the scripts fetched in parallel
                    + fetch scripts resources in parallel
-> Async does not guarantee the order of execution but defer does
-> Transitive dependency: A module that you didn't install directly, but one of your direct dependencies did
