-> Hardware -> Host OS -> Virtual Machine(HyperVisor) -> Guest OS -> we will run our Application here
   - with the the help of docker we can pack this Guest OS and ship it to the services
   - Images bundle only user-space dependencies
   - VMs bundle full OS + kernel
-> Containers was same as HyperVisor , only difference is in containers we dont install new OS , all the containers will share the same OS Kernal
   - Containers don't bring their own OS kernel — they share the host's kernel and only bundle the user-space dependencies they need.
-> Hardware -> Host OS -> Docker -> we will run our Application inside the conainter

-> Commands
   - docker run hello-world
   - docker ps -a ( ps: process status , a: all )
   - docker image ls ( list all the images )
   - docker rmi <ImageId> ( rmi : remove image )
   - docker rm <ContainerId> ( remove container )
   - docker image pull ubuntu:latest
   - docker exec -it peer0.org1.example.com bash :: This will navigate you directly to the peer bash terminal
   - docker run -it <IMAGE> bash :: This will navigate you directly to the conainer bash terminal ( i : interactive , t : terminal )
   - docker run -v <HOST_VOLUME_PATH>:<CONTAINER_VOLUME_PATH> 
      - if we dont specify the Host path with -v , then the default path will be /var/lib/docker/volumes 
-> We can get all public images here - https://hub.docker.com/
-> Difference between container and image
    - Image = blueprint (read-only) :: House blueprint 
    - Container = running (or stopped) instance of that blueprint :: Built house :: You can stop, restart, or destroy it
-> Docker daemon (dockerd) is the background service that actually does all the work in Docker. Docker daemon is the boss — the CLI just asks it to do things.
-> Docker Compose is needed to define, start, and manage multiple interdependent containers as a single application.
   - Docker alone runs one container.
   - Real systems (like Fabric) are many containers that must agree on networks, volumes, ports, and startup order.
-> Docker volumes are used for data persitence for stateful applications.
   - when we are using volumes for any container , the database path in container will be replaced by the path of the host machine
-> Dockerfile - Think of dockerfile as a set of instructions , a blueprint that tells Docker how to build your custom image
-> Docker Networking - Allows containers to communicate with each other
-> Docker scout - Checks and detects that vulnerabilities in the docker image with a known vulnerability database
