-> Hardware -> Host OS -> Virtual Machine(HyperVisor) -> Guest OS -> we will run our Application here
   - with the the help of docker we can pack this Guest OS and ship it to the services
-> Containers was same as HyperVisor , only difference is in containers we dont install new OS , all the containers will share the same OS Kernal
-> Hardware -> Host OS -> Docker -> we will run our Application inside the conainter
-> Play with docker - https://labs.play-with-docker.com/p/d53q97c69qi000cflsd0
-> Commands
   - docker run hello-world
   - docker ps -a ( ps: process status , a: all )
   - docker image ls ( list all the images )
   - docker rmi <ImageId> ( rmi : remove image )
   - docker rm <ContainerId> ( remove container )
   - docker image pull ubuntu:latest
-> We can get all public images here - https://hub.docker.com/
-> Difference between container and image
    - Image = blueprint (read-only) :: House blueprint 
    - Container = running (or stopped) instance of that blueprint :: Built house :: You can stop, restart, or destroy it
-> Docker daemon (dockerd) is the background service that actually does all the work in Docker. Docker daemon is the boss — the CLI just asks it to do things.
