-> FACET - Breaks down the result into groups based on an attribute, similar to SQL GROUP BY.
-> count(*) - 	An aggregation function that returns the total number of matching events.
-> httpResponseCode = 0 
    - Request was never completed - This often happens when a request was aborted or failed to even reach the server (e.g. network error, CORS rejection, or browser cancellation).
    - Client-side issues - JavaScript fetch or XHR was blocked by an ad blocker, firewall, or the user navigated away before completion.
    - No valid HTTP response - The browser tried to make a request but didn't get any actual HTTP response—so there's no real status code (like 200, 404, etc.).
