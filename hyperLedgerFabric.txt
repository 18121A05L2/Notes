-> Fabric is a private blockchain and it has this feature called creating subnets and we call them as channels
-> MSP ( Membership Service Provider ) - if we want to request to be a member of this private blockchain network we need to request or enroll throught this
-> we can write smart contracts on this using chaincode
-> Leader has two parts 
    - world state
    - transaction logs
-> byfn ( build your first network ) - creates channels and multiple oraganizations , and these orgaizations have multiple peers
-> Terms :: orgaization , network config , certificate authority , orderer , consortium , channel , channelconfig , peer , Ledger , smart contracts
-> Order is responsible for ordering the transaction and publishing it to other nodes
-> Difference between CFT ( Crash Fault Tolerance ) and BFT ( Byzantine Fault Tolerance )
-> Application 1 will endorse the transaction to Peer1 and all the Peers on that need to sign it, then it will send the transaction to the Orderer and the Orderer will finalize it send it to all the Peers

-> Two peers are required to avoid downtime and endorsement failures
    - We need only one CA(Certificate Authority) for each organization
-> peer lifecycle chaincode querycommitted   -C mychannel   -n basic 
    - endorsement policy is stored on the channel as part of the committed chaincode definition.
-> the same peer can play multiple roles
    - Endorsing peers simulate and sign transactions
    - Committing peers validate and write transactions to the ledger


--------------- Commands ------------------------------
-> peer channel list - Which peers joined which channel



Why do we need multiple orderers ?
