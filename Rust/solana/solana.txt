-> A Program Derived Address (PDA) is a special type of account address that is controlled by a Solana program, not by a private key.
    - Normally, Solana accounts (like user wallets) are derived from a private/public keypair.
    - But a PDA is derived mathematically from a program ID + some seeds, using Solana's cryptographic functions.
    - Since PDAs don't have a valid private key, only the program that owns them can sign for them
-> Transaction object 
    - signatures
    - Message
        - Header ( metadata )
        - Account addresses
        - Recent blockhash
        - Instructions
            - Program ID ( the smart contract the transaction will interact with )
            - Accounts ( Array of accounts, which contains the state information about the user )
                - Signer
                - Read only 
                - Executable 
                - Rent

-> Serialization means converting structured data (Rust structs, enums, etc.) into raw bytes 
-> Solana programns consist of a bunch of instructions and each instruction has specific logic based on that instruction and those instructions interact with accounts to be able to modify data
    - solana programs are stateless , They dont store any data , instead everything lives inside accounts
    - solana programs stores the program state in accounts
    - an instruction is an single call to a program, its essentially a function call and it specifies operations to process on chain
    - a transaction is a bundle of one or more instructions that is signed and it send to the network
    - for a wallet account owner will be the system program
    - owner is the account that has the permisssion to be able to change the sol balance in the account and also change the data in the account 
    - all transactions are atomic - meaning that if one instruction fails, all if the instructions reverted and the transaction fails
-> Account type
pub struct Account {
    pub lamports: u64,
    pub owner : Pubkey,
    pub data: Vec<u8>,
    pub executable: bool,( if this is true , then the account contains a deployed solana program, meaning it store executable code and it can be invoked )
}                        ( if it is false, then it was created by program to store and manage data)
-> Address of an account is an 32 byte address , base58 encoded string 
     - this address could be one of ed25519 public key or program derived address
     - to be able to store data onchain account must also keep a lamport balance that is proportional to the amount of data stored in the account in bytes
        - this balance is like a rent and works like a deposit and once the account is closed we can recover the full balance that you have paid in rent

-> An account essentially holds all of the state of a program. Because of this, all data is passed by reference from the outside
