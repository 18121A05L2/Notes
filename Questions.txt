what is , snark the whole chain ?
How arrays storage slot looks like
How to decode a abi.encodePacked data types

difference between a 'collision attack' and a 'preimage attack' - It is harder to engineer an attack without a known preimage
Where does metamask store the private key ?
How metamask new account creation works
How a social recovery wallet works end to end
why dont we aumtoically define the Data location for Reference type as it always be memory
