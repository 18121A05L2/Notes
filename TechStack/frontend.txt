--> updating package inside a package
    In this example, any instance of multer used by express-openapi-validator will be overridden to version 1.4.4-lts.1. This method is particularly useful for addressing vulnerabilities or ensuring consistency across your dependency tree
    {
        "overrides": {
            "express-openapi-validator": {
                "multer": "1.4.4-lts.1"
                }
        }
    }
