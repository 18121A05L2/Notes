-> O(1) refers to constant complexity, where the algorithm's performance is not affected by the input size, while O(n) refers to linear 
    complexity, where algorithm performance scales linearly with the input size.


-> Complexity   Name                                	                                               Example
    O(1)        constant time	      Takes the same time regardless of input size                     Array lookup
    O(n)	    linear time	          Time grows proportionally with input size                        Loop over array
    O(log n)	logarithmic time	  Reduces the problem size by half each time                       Binary search
    O(n log n)  linearithmic time	  Common in efficient sorting algorithms                           Merge sort / Quick sort
    O(n²)	    quadratic time	      Nested loops — time grows exponentially with input               Nested loops / Bubble sort
    O(2ⁿ)	    exponential time	  Time doubles with each added input — very slow for large input   Recursive Fibonacci, brute-force




-> difference between O(n) and O(logn)
-> You can prove inclusion (Merkle proof) of a leaf with a small log₂(n) proof. in Incremental Merkle tree
