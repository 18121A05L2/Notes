--> using all possible multipe selectors in css

--> AJAX - asynchronous java script and xml - It allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amount of data with the server
	- With out AJAX previously we had to refresh the page to get the new content ( or any piece of information we need in the current page ) from the server
	- Javascript talks to the server through a set of set of programming methods called API and uses whats called XHR or XML HTTPRequest
	- AJAX is not a programming language , it is what we called the framework for javascript
	  let a = new XMLHttpRequest
	  a.open("GET","https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
      a.send()

--> const arr2 = [0, 1, [2, [3, [4, 5]]]];
	console.log(arr2.flat(Infinity));

--> splice is only for arrays , use substring for strings

--> regex will be helpful in the replace or repalce all of the string methods

--> numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b)  -- sorting array in javascript using a callback function

--> if we pass extra arguments for the function , then it just ignores , it wont be an error

--> spread operator : makes the array to individuals  ,, Rest operator : takes the values and make up the array

--> because of the drawbacks of the waterfall model ,, agile came to the present tech
--> agile : 1) continuous delivery 2) collaboration  
--> Scrum is an Agile Development Methodology initially created to speed up software development

--> sort and fill actually changes the origianl array ,, map and filter will return array and reduce can return based on the acc initialization

--> Leading 0 (zero) on an integer literal, or leading 0o (or 0O) indicates it is in octal. Octal integers can include only the digits 0-7
	- const a = 0o10; // 8 in decimal
	- const b = 0o7;  // 7 in decimal

--> The Array.from() static method creates a new, shallow-copied Array instance from an iterable or array-like object

--> Asynchronous generators
	- Each yield returns a Promise under the hood
	- for await...of
		- This syntax is used to consume async iterables
		- It waits for each Promise to resolve before continuing
		- Works similarly to for...of, but handles async data like streams, paginated APIs, etc.

const fetchPages = async function* () {
	for (let page = 1; page <= 3; page++) {
	  const data = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/page=${page}`).then(res => res.json());
	  yield data;
	}
  };
  
  (async () => {
	for await (const pageData of fetchPages()) {
	  console.log(pageData);
	}
  })();

--> Array.from in js

  For numbers you can use ES6 Array.from(), which works in everything these days except IE:
  
  Shorter version:
  
  Array.from({length: 20}, (x, i) => i);
  Longer version:
  
  Array.from(new Array(20), (x, i) => i);​​​​​​
  which creates an array from 0 to 19 inclusive. This can be further shortened to one of these forms:
  
  Array.from(Array(20).keys());
  // or
  [...Array(20).keys()];
  Lower and upper bounds can be specified too, for example:
  
  Array.from(new Array(20), (x, i) => i + *lowerBound*);
