--> npx create-next-app nextjs-blog

--> npm run dev

--> import Link from "next/link"

--> SEO stands for 'Search Engine Optimization', which is the process of getting traffic from free, organic, editorial, or natural search results
    in search engines

--> nextjs is good for search engine optimization   

--> nextjs uses server side rendering where as the react js uses the client side rendering

--> provide the first letter of all the pages with the small letter ,if you use catital letters it may cause error when loading

--> index.js file is the root page for the folders corresponding to it that was present all the folder present in the pages folder of nextjs

--> file name in a square  brackets is treated as dynamic route

--> 400 routes corresponds to the 400 pages in our next js project

--> replace will replace the current history state , 

--> link is used for client side rendering , and we should use anchor tag when we want to deal with client side rendering cause for each anchor tag as it 
    make a new server request 

--> using anchor tag would be better when we want to deal with external website

--> the .next file will be different for dev and build

--> when we dont have anchor tag inside the link component , use passHref 

--> for dynamic paths we need to use getStaticPaths

--> yarn add swr

--> use swr instead of react hook in data fetching , it has more advantages

--> You can start by replacing useSWR with useSWRImmutable to disable the automatic revalidation done by SWR

--> dont call the own api , in the getStaticProps and getServerSideProps , 

--> use Image from "next/image" , it provides lazyloading , blur and less bytes of webpack images

--> object-contain in css tailwind makes it pixel perfect
