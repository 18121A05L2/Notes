-> DexTools 
    - Token update on dex tools - https://www.dextools.io/marketplace/en/create-socials ( It was asking for payment and some docs says initial requires does not require any payment)
        - Do this with the company wallet address
    - As soon as the first trade executes on that QuickSwap pool, DEXTools should detect and index the pair automatically.
    - No strict minimum liquidity or volume is required for basic visibility, but very low-liquidity pools might take longer to appear or show lower in searches

-> Sniper Bots Mitigation strategies
    - The "Trap" Tax (High Initial Taxes):
       - How it works: You code the contract to have adjustable taxes. At launch, you set the Buy/Sell tax to 99%.
       - The Strategy: 1. Add Liquidity. 2. Bots snipe immediately. 3. The 99% tax means they pay for the tokens but receive almost nothing (or the tax goes to the LP/Marketing wallet). 4. After 5–10 minutes (or a specific block count), you manually lower the tax to your normal rate (e.g., 5%).
    - Trading Enable Switch:
       - How it works: Pause trading by default (tradingEnabled = false). You can add liquidity freely while trading is paused.
       - The Launch: Once liquidity is added and stable, you call a function enableTrading()
    - Launch Strategy (Process Flow)
        - If you are managing the launch yourself, follow this sequence to confuse basic bots:
        - Deploy Contract: Ensure tradingEnabled is set to false.
        - Mint Tokens: Send tokens to your deployer wallet.
        - Create the Pair: Create the Token/MATIC pair on QuickSwap manually without adding full liquidity yet (or add a tiny amount of test liquidity if needed, but be careful).
        - Add Full Liquidity: Add your MATIC and Tokens to the pool. Since tradingEnabled is false, bots will see the liquidity but the transaction will fail if they try to buy.
        - Enable with High Tax: Set tax to 99%. Call enableTrading().
        - Wait: Let the aggressive snipers fail or get taxed 99%.
        - Normalize: Lower tax to normal levels and announce to your community that trading is live.

-> Sandwitch attacks mitigation ( Not Recommended as it increases gas fee)
    - Cooldown Timers (Anti-MEV):
        - Add a requirement that a single wallet cannot buy and sell in the same block.
        - Why it works: A sandwich attack requires a Buy-UserBuy-Sell sequence all in one block. By forcing a 1-block or 30-second delay between trades, the bot is forced to hold the tokens, exposing them to market risk.

        function _update(address from, address to, uint256 value) internal virtual override {
            if (cooldownEnabled) {
                // Prevents buying and selling in the same block
                require(_lastTradeBlock[tx.origin] < block.number, "Cooldown: One trade per blockm per address");
                _lastTradeBlock[tx.origin] = block.number;
            }
            super._update(from, to, value);
        }
