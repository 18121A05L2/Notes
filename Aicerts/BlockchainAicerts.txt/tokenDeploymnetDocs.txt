-> DexTools 
    - Token update on dex tools - https://www.dextools.io/marketplace/en/create-socials ( It was asking for payment and some docs says initial requires does not require any payment)
        - Do this with the company wallet address
    - As soon as the first trade executes on that QuickSwap pool, DEXTools should detect and index the pair automatically.
    - No strict minimum liquidity or volume is required for basic visibility, but very low-liquidity pools might take longer to appear or show lower in searches

-> How and Where to Lock liquidity
-> liquidity mananger  ( https://defillama.com/protocols/Liquidity%20manager )
    - Most locked liquidity mananger - Steer Protocol
    - Most Polygon liquidity mananger - Gama Protocol
        - Better first impression on QuickSwap
    - Who owns LP tokens if i use liquidity manager - The V3 LP NFT is owned by the liquidity manager vault , liquidity manager manages it on your behalf
        - instead we will get liquidity manager ERC20 token This token represents: Your proportional share
    - You give up LP control in exchange for automated range management.
    - Gamma rebalances by fully exiting and re-entering positions, not sliding them.
    - does this liquidity mananger have any cooling period to withdraw our lp ?
        - does it have any withdrawl delay , temporary pause ?
    - what are the percentages from the custom range price for the position rebalancing for narrow range and wide range and which one to choose ?

-> Sniper Bots 
    - Explanation ::  Sniper bots quickly buy newly listed tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEX) before human traders can react. These bots monitor the blockchain for new token listings and execute purchases almost instantly.
    - Mitigation Strategies: ( These needs to be implemented in the contract )
        - Cooldown Timers :: you could disable transfers for anyone that isn't the owner for a few hours/days and then activate it again. Thus the bots hoepfully wont hit up your token as it's already older.
        - Initial High tax ::  Program a temporary buyTax and sellTax (e.g., 90%) for the first 1-5 blocks.
    - Trading Enable Switch: ( exception owner from this by coding it in the contract )
       - How it works: Pause trading by default (tradingEnabled = false). You can add liquidity freely while trading is paused.
       - The Launch: Once liquidity is added and stable, you call a function enableTrading()

-> Flash bots ( private RPC ) (  one way to decrease the chances from sniper bots , but cant totally stop them )

    - Sepolia	https://rpc-sepolia.flashbots.net/
    - How to add - https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/quick-start
    - does flash bot rpc charges us more ? NO

-> snipers on scenario of locked liquidity  vs unlocked liquidity ? - Sniper aggression will be medium instead of high , Not much difference it will still do 

-> 20 tokens + 2 dollars usd ( 0.1 dollar price )

-> Sandwitch attacks mitigation ( Not Recommended as it increases gas fee)
    - Cooldown Timers (Anti-MEV):
        - Add a requirement that a single wallet cannot buy and sell in the same block.
        - Why it works: A sandwich attack requires a Buy-UserBuy-Sell sequence all in one block. By forcing a 1-block or 30-second delay between trades, the bot is forced to hold the tokens, exposing them to market risk.

        function _update(address from, address to, uint256 value) internal virtual override {
            if (cooldownEnabled) {
                // Prevents buying and selling in the same block
                require(_lastTradeBlock[tx.origin] < block.number, "Cooldown: One trade per blockm per address");
                _lastTradeBlock[tx.origin] = block.number;
            }
            super._update(from, to, value);
        }
