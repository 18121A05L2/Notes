-> Fabric is a private blockchain and it has this feature called creating subnets and we call them as channels
-> MSP ( Membership Service Provider ) - if we want to request to be a member of this private blockchain network we need to request or enroll throught this
-> we can write smart contracts on this using chaincode
-> Leader has two parts 
    - world state
    - transaction logs
-> test-network from fabric samples - creates channels and multiple oraganizations , and these orgaizations have multiple peers
-> Terms :: orgaization , network config , certificate authority , orderer , consortium , channel , channelconfig , peer , Ledger , smart contracts
-> Orderer is responsible for ordering the transaction and publishing it to other nodes
-> Difference between CFT ( Crash Fault Tolerance ) and BFT ( Byzantine Fault Tolerance )
-> Application 1 will endorse the transaction to Peer1 and all the Peers on that need to sign it, then it will send the transaction to the Orderer and the Orderer will finalize it send it to all the Peers

-> Two peers are required to avoid downtime and endorsement failures
    - We need only one CA(Certificate Authority) for each organization
-> peer lifecycle chaincode querycommitted -C mychannel -n basic 
    - endorsement policy is stored on the channel as part of the committed chaincode definition.
-> the same peer can play multiple roles
    - Endorsing peers simulate and sign transactions
    - Committing peers validate and write transactions to the ledger
-> Difference between installed vs approved vs committed
| Stage   | Scope   | Required by          | Purpose              |
| ------- | ------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Install | Peer    | Every endorsing peer | Has the code         |
| Approve | Org     | Every required org   | Agrees to definition |
| Commit  | Channel | Once                 | Activates chaincode  |
-> osnadmin is an Orderer System Network Admin tool ( OSN - Ordering Service Node )
-> if we delete a channel from orderer and if that channel still present on the peer node 
   - This is a detached / orphaned channel on the peer. Peer cannot receive new blocks
-> Peer hosts chaincode, but chaincode runs separately 
   - dev-peer0.org2.example.com-basic_1.0-<hash> :: Chaincode runtime container
   - Fabric isolates chaincode execution
   - Chaincode containers are created on first invoke, not on deploy
-> Exploration Roadmap
    - Network → Identity → Channel → Chaincode → Endorsement → Operations
-> HFC ( HyperLedger Fabric Client SDK )
-> Multiple orderers are needed for fault tolerance, high availability, and decentralized trust when creating blocks
    - Majority must be alive
    - For mutile orderers we need Raft ordering service cluster





--------------- Commands ------------------------------
-> peer channel list :: Which peers joined which channel
-> docker exec peer0.org1.example.com peer channel list :: Check from inside the peer container
-> docker-compose down -v ( v to remove volumes which delete databases here) ( ledger wiped clean )
-> docker-compose up -d ( -d to run in detached mode) ( Terminal is NOT attached )
-> peer lifecycle chaincode queryinstalled :: To check installed chaincodes on the current peer
-> env | grep CORE_PEER :: To see the current organization and peer info
-> source ./setOrgEnv.sh org2 :: Switch organization
-> docker logs peer0.org1.example.com --tail 50 :: TO check current peer node logs
-> docker volume prune -a :: To delete all unused volumes ( If we dont delete this , we may see prvious state of channels , ledgers etc...)






Why do we need multiple orderers ?
