-> how about building an free audit smart contract platform
-> P2P network on smart contracts ( Binance p2p)
    - IZKPs can be used to verify the authenticity of financial transactions without revealing the specific details of the transaction
-> Cross rollup relaying porotocols (like L1 -> L2 -> L1) or (L2 - L2 )
-> permissioned bank blockchains ( centralized bank blockchains )
-> EMI's on blockchain
-> Chrom extentions like sponsor or ad skip for youtube videos
-> How about raising an EIP , by wrapping around ERC20 and adding something like tags , so that if someone hacks any ERC20 token we can block those hacked tokens by having each token a unique identifier mapped to the tags
    - we can add this one to the base ETH which we pays for gas
-> Todays hardware wallet sucks , we need to implement robust and clearly users can see what they are signing
-> why we need to provide liquidity to each individual pool pair , what if we have something like provide liquidiy to a pool where we can trade every asset in that pool ( need a robust formulae for this)
-> if we do a small change in our smart contract , we need to redeploy the whole smart contract again , do we have a way so that the redeployment cost will be less
-> combining multi blockchain worlds ( kind of what polkadot is going to do )
-> parallel block production 
    - consider , if we have 1000 transactions in the queue , and why dont we classify each of these transactions and 
        - process in sequential order only those modifies the same global state
        - and parallel processing for the rest of the transactions
-> why cant the nodes index the blocchain data
-> when doing AMM swap function , we are updating many storage variables , but if the pool is worth of 1 million and if we are doing a 100 dollars transaction , can we do something like decrease the storage data modificatin less like we will update all small value transactions after certain time frame like 5-10 minutes ( aim with this is to provide a cheaper transactions fee )
-> do we have something like timer attached to a storage data which deletes when the timer reaches zero
